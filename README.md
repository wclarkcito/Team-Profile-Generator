# Team-Profile-Generator

## This application allows the user to dynamically create a Team Roster. When prompted the user will be asked to enter the Manager's name, ID number, Email address as well as the office number. The user will then be asked whether or not they would like to add an Engineer or an Intern to the team. The Engineer option will run through the same prompts as the Manager excluding the office number, but requesting github username. The Intern option will respectively do the same, but rather than requesting GitHub info it will ask for the school they are attending.
